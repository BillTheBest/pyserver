[x] message expiration: expire old or orphaned messages
[x] clean messages table (delete messages for non-existant users)
[x] reject messages to unknown users? (usercache must be always valid)
[x] still problems when posting a file more than once (first: error, next: success - file goes wrong)
[x] table indexes
